# Lesson 9: Project - Globetrotter

## Learning Objectives
- Plan and execute drawings of defined shapes with specified measurements
- Practice positioning with coordinates
- Apply mathematical concepts to refine proportions of components

## Project Brief
In this project, you'll be "travelling" around the world by drawing flags! At their core, flags are just combinations of different colors and shapes, so you'll be able to see how well you can plan your drawings (breakdown of colors and shapes) to replicate them on Turtle Graphics. As an added challenge, try to write your code in the fewest lines possible.

If finding the exact coordinates or angles for certain components in a flag is too difficult, you may refer to Scripts (Answer Key) > Lesson 9 Scripts folder *after* you've written the lines of code for each component of the flag.
