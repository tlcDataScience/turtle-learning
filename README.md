## Scope of Learning
**Goal:** To give a foundational understanding of Python Turtle  
**Duration:** 12 lessons (1.5 hours per lesson)

## Learning Guidelines
This course will introduce the basics of the Turtle Graphics library in Python. It will focus on building an understanding of Turtle through a combination of step-by-step guides, multiple-choice questions, short exercises, and projects. The codes given serve as a reference, but students are welcome to explore alternative solutions.

## Turtle Learning Outline
> Note: The concepts in Lesson 0 will not be tested, but please read through it as it contains important information for the actual setup and lessons.
- Lessons 1-10 can be done on **trinket.io**, while Lessons 11-12 must be done on **Visual Studio Code**
- Setup instructions are on Lesson 0 (use Template.py from Scripts (Answer Key) > Lesson 0 Scripts)

> Make sure to save all of your files!
- **(Recommended)** Copying your code onto an online platform like Google Colab (can't run the program, but you can copy and paste your code from it the next time you do an activity)
- Downloading your code from trinket.io onto your laptop (especially if you are not finished, or else you might have to redo some activities)

> Ensure you rename your files in the following format: Name_LessonNumber (e.g. JohnDoe_Lesson3)
