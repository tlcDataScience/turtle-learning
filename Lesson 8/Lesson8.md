# Lesson 8: Project - Mazes, Mazes, Mazes

## Learning Objectives
- Solidify knowledge of Turtle movement
- Develop problem-solving skills by debugging issues that arise during the solving of the mazes
- Be exposed to the ways in which images can be used with Turtle Graphics on trinket.io (do not use Visual Studio Code for this project)

## One Step Closer
You've learned the fundamental concepts of Turtle Graphics (Lessons 1-7). From Lesson 8 (now) to Lesson 12 (end), you will be taking on different projects of your own with a range of activities for you to try. Each project comes with a project brief and steps to set up, so make sure to read them carefully. Enjoy!

## Project Brief
In this project, you'll be solving mazes to get your turtle through from start to finish. There are 10 mazes in this collection, and each one is uploaded on Turtle Graphics using the function `screen.bgpic("filename.png")`. Follow the steps below to set up each maze.

## Steps

### Step 1
Login to https://trinket.io/turtle with the following details. Without logging in, you won't be able to upload the maze images. Since trinket.io is an online platform, you face fewer issues with uploading the images, as compared to dealing with local storage locations using Visual Studio Code on your laptop.

### Step 2
Click "Home" at the top left corner.

### Step 3
Click "View All My Trinkets".

### Step 4
Click "Lesson 8: Mazes, Mazes, Mazes" then make a copy of it by clicking the "Copy" button located at the top right. You can also access the file at this link: https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/f503fac2b7 (make sure you're logged in)
> Make sure you have created a copy. Do NOT directly edit this file as other students will need to use it too.

### Step 4 Extension (in case the file has been modified accidentally and you need to remake it)
Click on the image icon located at the top right of the code editor. You may refer to https://blog.trinket.io/using-images-in-turtle-programs/ for extra information. Save the 10 maze images directly onto your laptop from https://www.pythonclassroom.com/turtle-graphics/turtle-maze, then upload them on trinket.io when prompted.

### Step 5
The start positions for each maze have been pre-set for you. Copy and paste the code from the Lesson 8 folder (the same one you clicked to find this set of lesson notes) in this repository for each maze on trinket.io. For example, if you are doing Maze 1, copy the code from Maze1Student.py onto trinket.io.

### Step 6
Solve the mazes by writing lines of code and see how many you can do!

### Debugging Tips
- While solving the maze, there may be times you see an issue that you want to fix right away before your code is finished executing. You can press the "Stop" button (gray square in the trinket.io top menu) for this.
- Understand what may have gone wrong by reading the error message in the Terminal. It may give a clue to the line number/s that have issues.
- Check if all of your variable names are consistent. Variables names are case-sensitive, so errors here will cause issues in running the code.
- Check your code indentation levels (`Tab` to shift inwards, `Shift + Tab` to shift outwards). You may have accidentally moved something to the wrong place.
- As always, you may reference the Scripts (Answer Key) > Lesson 8 Scripts folder in this repository if all of the above are not working.

## Demo
Run your mazes and ensure that everything is working properly!
